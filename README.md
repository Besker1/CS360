# GhromeList Inventory App

The **GhromeList Inventory App** was created to help users track pantry stock efficiently and prevent food waste. The app includes an inventory screen for adding and removing items, as well as a notification system that alerts users when items are low. The UI is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, allowing users to organize items in a way that best suits their needs. By focusing on clear, intuitive design, the app meets its goals for ease of use.


The development process involved modular codingâ€”implementing each function individually and testing it for stability. 
This approach helped reveal early bugs and facilitated the smooth integration of SMS notifications. 
Through consistent testing, we identified improvements to the UI that enhanced usability and user experience. Integrating notifications posed challenges, particularly with Android permissions, which led to valuable learning in app functionality and user-centered design.
